<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome To Quantum Healing</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center;"><strong style="background-color: #317399; padding: 0 5px; color: #fff;">Quantum healing has origin from quantum mechanics, psychology, neuroscience, and spirituality.</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">The human body can essentially be broken down to smallest particles and these particles per the recent advances in Quantum physics are nothing by vortex of energies.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Human consciousness perceives this form of energy as matter. Our emotions and feelings can strike these energies out of balance or say out of rhythm with Nature/Creator. This unintended misalignment of energies become source of diseases/illness in human body. Quantum healing in simple terms tries to put this imbalance of these energies back into alignment with Nature/Creator. This healing essentially tries to correct the emotions and feelings in humans.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Each session with quantum healer may vary from 30 min to 1 hour and number of sessions needed depend on how deep the imbalance in patient. One of critical factor in this healing is the attitude patient brings in along with them. Quantum way of living will be suggested along with this healing process. Adherence to this suggested way living will be of paramount importance, so as to minimize the recurrence of symptoms.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Please note that patient should CONTINUE to take their medicines as prescribed by qualified doctors. Quantum healing will in no way interfere with these medicines. Instead, this healing should assist in quicker healing of the symptoms and provide you a greater sense of well-being.</p>
